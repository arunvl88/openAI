### Function Calling:

Pros: Offers more control, reliability, and avoids potential token limitations in the language model.
Cons: Requires more technical effort and integration into your workflow.

### Prompt Tuning:

Pros: Easier to implement, faster to modify, works directly in the natural language interface.
Cons: Relies on the modelâ€™s interpretation of the prompt, which may still encounter token limit issues for very long entries.
